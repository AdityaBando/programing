//                              A bag of cookies holds 40 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that
//                              there are 10 "servings" on the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a
//                              program that asks the user to enter the number of cookies they actually ate and then
//                              report the total calories consumed.
